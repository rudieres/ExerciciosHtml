    <h1>WorldWideWeb distributed code</h1>


<p>See the CERN copyright . This is the README file which you get when you unwrap 
one of our tar files. These files contain information about hypertext, hypertext 
systems, and the WorldWideWeb project. If you have taken this with a .tar file, 
you will have only a subset of the files.</p>

<p>THIS FILE IS A VERY ABRIDGED VERSION OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE WEB. IF 
IN DOUBT, READ THE WEB DIRECTLY. If you have not got any browser installed, do this 
by telnet to info.cern.ch (no username or password).</p>


<h2>Archive Directory structure</h2>

<dl>

<p>Under /pub/www, besides this README file, you'll find bin, src and doc directories. 
The main archives are as follows:</p>

<dt>src/WWWLibrary_v.vv.tar.Z</dt>
    <dd>The W3 Library. All source, and Makefiles for selected systems.</dd>

<dt>src/WWWLineMode_v.vv.tar.Z</dt>
    <dd>The Line mode browser - all source, and Makefiles for selected systems. Requires the Library .</dd>

<dt>src/WWW/LineModeDefaults_v.vv.tar.Z
    <dd> The on-line doucmnetation for the line mode browser, which you 
        may still want if you get the program as binary. A subset of the full source above.</dd>

<dt>src/WWWNextStepEditor.tar.Z</dt>
    <dd>The Hypertext Browser/editor for the NeXT -- source and binary.</dd>

<dt>src/WWWDaemon_v.vv.tar.Z</dt>
    <dd>The HTTP daemon, and WWW-WAIS gateway programs. Source.</dd>

<dt>doc/WWWBook.tar.Z</dt>
    <dd>A snapshot of our internal documentation - 
        we prefer you to access this on line -- see warnings below.</dd>

<dt>bin/xxx/bbbb</dt>
    <dd>Executable binaries of program bbbb for system xxx. Check what's there before 
    you bother compiling. (Note HP is called "snake")</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Generated Directory structure</h2>


<p>The tar files are all designed to be unwrapped in the same (this) directory.
     They create different parts of a common directory tree under that directory. 
     There may be some duplication. They also generate a few files in this directory: 
     README.*, Copyright.*, and some installation instructions (.txt).</p>


<h2>NeXTStep Browser/Editor</h2>


<p>The browser for the NeXT is those files contained in the application directory 
WWW/Next/Implementation/WorldWideWeb.app and is compiled.Whe you install the app, 
you may want to configure the default page, WorldWideWeb.app/default.html. 
These must point to some useful information! You should keep it up to date 
with pointers to info on your site and elsewhere. If you use the CERN home 
page note there is a link at the bottom to the master copy on our server. 
See Installation instructions.</p>


<h2>Line Mode browser</h2>


<p>Binaries of this for some systems are available in /pub/www/bin/ .</p>

<p>. If the binary exists for your system, take that and also the 
    /pub/www/WWWLineModeDefaults.tar.Z. Unwrap the documentation, 
    and put (link) its directory into /usr/local/lib/WWW on your 
    machine. Put the www executable into your path somewhere, and 
    away you go.</p>

<p>If no binary exists, procede as follows. Take the source 
    tar file WWWLineMode_v.vv.tar.Z , uncompress and untar 
    it. You will then find the line Mode browser in 
    WWW/LineMode/Implementation/... (See Installation notes ). 
    Do the same thing (in the same directory) to the 
    WWWLibrary_v.cc.tar.Z file to get the common library.</p>

<p>You will have an ASCII printable manual in the file 
    WWW/LineMode/Defaults/line-mode-guide.txt which you 
    can print out at this stage. This is a frozen copy 
    of some of the online documentation.</p>

<p>Subdirectories to WWW/LineMode contain Makefiles for systems 
    to which we have already ported. If your system is not 
    among them, make a new subdirectory with the system name, 
    and copy the Makefile from an existing one. Change the directory 
    names as needed. PLEASE INFORM US OF THE CHANGES WHEN YOU HAVE 
    DONE THE PORT. This is a condition of your use of this code, 
    and will save others repeating your work, and save you 
    repeating it in future releases.</p>

<p>Whe you install the browsers, you should configure the default 
    page. This is /usr/local/lib/WWW/default.html for the line mode 
    browser. This must point to some useful information! You should 
    keep it up to date with pointers to info on your site and elsewhere.
     If you use the CERN home page note there is a link at the bottom 
     to the master copy on our server.</p>

<p>Some basic documentation on the browser is delivered with the home 
    page in the directory WWW/LineMode/Defaults. A separate tar file 
    of that directory (WWWLineModeDefaults.tar.Z) is available if you 
    just want to update that.</p>

<p>The rest of the documentation is in hypertext, and so wil be readable 
    most easily with a browser. We suggest that after installing the 
    browser, you browse through the basic documentation so that you are 
    aware of the options and customisation possibilities for example.</p>


<h2>Viola browser for X11</h2>


<p>Viola is an X11 application for reading global hypertext. If a binary is 
    available from your machine, in /pub/www/bin/.../viola*, then take that 
    and also the Viola "apps" tar file which contains the scripts you will need.</p>

<p>To generate this from source, you will need both the W3 library and the Viola 
    source files. There is an Imakefile with the viola source directory. You will 
    need to generate the XPA and XPM libraries and the W3 library befere you make 
    viola itself.</p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>


<p>In the /pub/www/doc directory are a number articles, preprints and guides on the web.</p>

<p>See the online WWW bibliography for a list of these and other articles, books, etc.</p>

<p>The archive /pub/www/doc/WWWBook.tar.Z is an extract of the text from 
    the WorldWideWeb (WWW) project documentation.</p>

<p>This is a snapshot of a changing hypertext system. The text is provided as 
    example hypertext only, not for general distribution. The accuracy of any 
    information is not guaranteed, and no responsibility will be accepted by 
    the authors for any loss or damage due to inaccuracy or omission. A copy 
    of the documentation is inevitably out of date, and may be inconsistent. 
    There are links to information which is not provided in that tar file. 
    If any of these facts cause a problem, you should access the original 
    master data over the network using www, or mail us.</p>


<h2>Servers</h2>


<p>The Daemon tar file contains (in this release) the code for the basic HTTP 
    daemon for serving files, and also for the WWW-WAIS gateway. To compile the 
    WAIS gateway, you will need [a link to] a WAIS distribution at the same level 
    as the WWW directory.</p>


<h2>General</h2>


<p>Your comments will of course be most appreciated, on code, or information on 
    the web which is out of date or misleading. If you write your own hypertext 
    and make it available by anonymous ftp or using a server, tell us and we'll 
    put some pointers to it in ours. Thus spreads the web...</p>
