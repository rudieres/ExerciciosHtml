	<h1>Getting the WWW files</h1>

<p>Read this if you have not yet got the WWW files you need, 
	and you cannot NFS mount a directory on which they reside.</p>

<p>The source and binary of WWW project files are currently available (see copyright )
 by anonymous FTP from node info.cern.ch. This node is currently 128.141.201.74 
 but THIS MAY CHANGE. The files are compressed tape archive files (.tar.Z). 
 To get a file using anonymous FTP, use user name "anonymous", and your email 
 address as a password:-</p>

	<pre>
			> ftp info.cern.ch
			Enter user name: anonymous
			Password: me@myhost.edu
			ftp> cd /pub/www/src
			ftp> binary
			ftp> get WWWLineMode_vvv.tar.Z
			ftp> quit
			>
	</pre>

<p>The file name will depend on the product you want. Here vvv is the version number of the software.</p>
<p>Once you have the compressed tar file, you must uncompress it and unwrap it.</p>

	<pre>
			uncompress WWWLineMode_vvv.tar.Z
	</pre>

<p>This will make a rather larger file with the name without the ".Z". To unwrap it,</p>

	<pre>
			tar xvf WWWLineMode_vvv.tar
	</pre>		

<p>Now you should install the line mode browser , install the server , install Viola , etc.</p>
