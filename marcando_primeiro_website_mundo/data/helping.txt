How can I help?


There are lots of ways you can help if you are interested in seeing the web grow and be even more useful...

Put up some data
    There are many ways of doing this. The web needs both raw data -- fresh hypertext or old plain text files, or smart servers giving views of existing databases. See more details , etiquette.

Suggest someone else does
    Maybe you know a system which it would be neat to have on the web. How about suggesting to the person involved that they put up a W3 server?

Manage a subject area
    If you know something of what's going on in a particular field, organization or country, would you like to keep up-to-date an overview of online data?
